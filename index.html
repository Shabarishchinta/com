		<h1> What is Poverty? </h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				Poverty is a condition in which individuals or communities lack the financial resources necessary to meet basic needs such as food, shelter, clean water, healthcare, and education. It can be understood in two main ways: absolute and relative. Absolute poverty refers to the inability to afford basic necessities for survival, often measured against a global standard like the World Bank's poverty line of around $2.15 per day. On the other hand, relative poverty compares an individual's income to the average income of their society, highlighting disparities in wealth and access to opportunities. Poverty can lead to social exclusion, limited access to education and healthcare, and an overall lower quality of life, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage across generations.

			<p>
				Poverty has multiple interrelated causes, many of which are systemic and deeply rooted in social, economic, and political structures. One major cause is lack of education, where individuals are denied access to quality education, limiting their ability to gain skills necessary for higher-paying jobs. Without education, people often remain in low-skilled, low-paying jobs, making it difficult to break the cycle of poverty. Furthermore, children born into poverty often lack the educational resources needed to escape it, perpetuating poverty across generations.
			</p>
			<p>

                Another significant cause is unemployment or underemployment. In many areas, particularly in developing countries or regions with weak economies, there are not enough jobs available, or the jobs that exist are unstable and poorly paid. Even in developed countries, underemployment—where individuals work part-time or in jobs below their skill level—can contribute to poverty. Without reliable income, people cannot afford essential services like healthcare, housing, and food, which exacerbates their financial struggles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Economic inequality is another critical factor. When wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the population, it leaves others with fewer opportunities for upward mobility. This disparity often leads to a lack of access to resources such as quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, which traps individuals in poverty. Government policies that do not address wealth distribution can worsen this gap, as the rich continue to accumulate wealth while the poor struggle to meet basic needs.
            </p>
            <p>  
                Political instability, corruption, and conflict also play a role in causing poverty. In countries or regions with unstable governments or ongoing conflicts, economic development is often stunted, infrastructure is destroyed, and citizens are displaced or unable to work. Corruption can divert resources meant for public services or economic development into the hands of a few, leaving the majority without the support they need. In such environments, poverty rates tend to rise, as people lose access to jobs, education, and essential services.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Lastly, health issues and natural disasters can be immediate causes of poverty, especially for individuals or families who lack access to healthcare or insurance. Chronic illness or injury can prevent people from working, and without a safety net, medical expenses can drive families into debt. Similarly, natural disasters such as floods, droughts, or earthquakes can destroy homes, livelihoods, and infrastructure, leaving affected populations impoverished and vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, these factors create a web of circumstances that makes escaping poverty exceedingly difficult for many individuals and communities. Addressing poverty, therefore, requires a multifaceted approach, tackling education, employment, economic policies, and healthcare access, among other issues.

		<h1 style="margin-top: 100px;"> How can We Help Prevent Poverty? </h1>

			Preventing poverty requires a multi-dimensional approach that addresses both immediate needs and the underlying causes. One of the most effective long-term solutions is ensuring access to quality education for all. Education provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to secure better job opportunities and escape the cycle of poverty. Emphasizing education for marginalized groups, particularly women and girls, can have a significant impact, as it opens doors to economic independence. Additionally, vocational training and skills development programs can empower people to enter high-demand industries, enabling them to earn sustainable incomes and improve their quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another crucial factor in poverty prevention is creating economic opportunities through job creation and fair wages. Governments and businesses should invest in industries that promote inclusive economic growth, ensuring that employment opportunities are available in both urban and rural areas. Small business development and entrepreneurship can also play a vital role in reducing poverty, particularly in communities where large-scale job opportunities may be scarce. Providing access to microloans, financial literacy training, and affordable credit can help individuals start and grow businesses, creating pathways out of poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social safety nets and access to essential services are equally important in preventing poverty. Affordable healthcare, housing, and social welfare programs ensure that vulnerable populations are protected during economic downturns or personal hardships. Expanding healthcare access, in particular, helps prevent medical debt, which can push families into poverty. Strengthening these support systems ensures that people can maintain a basic standard of living even during times of crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, promoting gender equality and reducing social inequalities are critical to breaking the cycle of poverty. Women and minority groups often face barriers to economic participation, such as wage gaps or discrimination. Policies that promote equal pay, gender equality, and anti-discrimination measures in the workplace can help level the playing field. Encouraging the participation of all groups in economic, social, and political life will ensure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from economic growth.
